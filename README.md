Welcome to My Vivino

# Task
Building an ML model to predict the rating of low rated wines.

# Description
Our goal is not only make our customers happy, but do some analysis. Unfortunately, we don’t have the data we need, so let’s get it. Where to find the data? Any where. Scrap Vivino / Bevmo / Delectable / Wine-Searcher /


# Installation
Data exploration and preprocessing: Libraries like pandas and numpy help us understand and prepare us data.

Visualization and interpretability: matplotlib and seaborn aid in visualizing us data and understanding the relationships between features and the target variable.

Model building and selection: scikit-learn and gradient boosting frameworks allow us to build, train, and evaluate different models.
```
